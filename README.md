# Mini Landing (React + Tailwind)

Simple Vite + React + Tailwind starter with a landing page component.

How to run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the printed localhost URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes
- Tailwind is configured via `tailwind.config.cjs` and PostCSS.
- If you want me to run `npm install` and start the dev server for verification, tell me and I will run it.
